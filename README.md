# NBA Score Margins Visualizer (Working Title)

Explore play-by-play performance of the Miami Heat.

In this interactive chart, every game is a line, where the X-axis shows game time and the Y-axis shows score margins — positive when Miami Heat is leading and negative when behind.

The visualization includes 2 movable hoops that work as filters. Users can place these hoops on the chart to see only the games that “pass through the hoop” (i.e., had a specific score at a specific time, approximately), like leading in one quarter but losing in another. This makes it easy to analyze how games change over time and helps users focus on important moments.
